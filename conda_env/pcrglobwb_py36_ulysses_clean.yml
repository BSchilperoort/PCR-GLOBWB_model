# Notes: 
# - PCRaster 4.3.0 is available on cca and must be loaded for running PCR-GLOBWB (i.e. module load pcraster/4.3.0)
# - gdal is also available on cca and must be loaded for running PCR-GLOBWB (i.e. module load gdal/3.0.4). 
# - Note that it is required to load gdal after PCRaster. This is due to the fact that PCRaster 4.3.0 also includes a gdal compilation but with some issues on it.
